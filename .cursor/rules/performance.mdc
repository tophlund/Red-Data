Code-split builder bundle: lazy-load non-critical components using dynamic import().

Minimize initial data payload: paginate metric lists; lazy-load detailed metric data on demand.

Use memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to prevent unnecessary renders.

Debounce user input in search fields with a 300ms delay.

Optimize database queries: use Prismaâ€™s select to fetch only required fields.

Index frequently queried columns in database; audit slow queries quarterly.

Enable gzip or brotli compression for responses at server level.

Serve static assets with appropriate cache headers; invalidate on deploy via hashed filenames.

Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time AI suggestion updates instead of polling.
