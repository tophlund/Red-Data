Implement rate limiter middleware in app/utils/rateLimiter.ts; use in all POST and PUT routes.

Use Redis to store request counts per IP; expire counts after one minute.

Default limits: 100 requests per minute for authenticated users, 50 requests per minute for unauthenticated.

Return HTTP 429 with Retry-After header when limit exceeded.

Exclude health and static assets routes from rate limiting.

Log rate limit hits for analysis; adjust thresholds quarterly.

Apply stricter limits on AI suggestion endpoint: 10 requests per minute per user.

Provide error message template: { error: { code: 429, message: "Too Many Requests" } }.

Integrate with API gateway if scaling to multiple instances; synchronize counters.


Document rate limiting policy in docs/api-spec.md.
