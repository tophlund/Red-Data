Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines; audit UI with automated tools and manual testing.

Ensure all images have meaningful alt attributes; decorative images marked aria-hidden="true".

Use semantic HTML tags (<button>, <header>, <nav>, <main>) for structure.

Ensure keyboard navigability: all interactive elements must be reachable via Tab.

Provide visible focus indicators (e.g., outline) on focusable elements.

Use ARIA roles and labels for custom components (e.g., role="dialog", aria-modal="true" for modals).

Ensure form fields have associated <label> elements; use aria-describedby for additional context.

Avoid color-only indicators; combine color with text or icons for state information.

Test UI with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) at least biannually.


Include skip-links (<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>) for screen reader users.
