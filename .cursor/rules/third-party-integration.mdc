Abstract external API calls behind service interfaces; place under app/services/thirdParty/.

Validate responses from OpenAI against openaiSchema; reject if missing expected fields.

Throttle requests to OpenAI: limit to 60 requests per minute per API key.

Secure API keys in environment; rotate keys every six months.

Mock third-party services in tests; use Nock or equivalent.

Log third-party request latencies; alert if latency exceeds 500ms.

Version pin SDKs; avoid major version upgrades without compatibility testing.

Use retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network errors (max 3 retries).

Encrypt payloads in transit; require HTTPS for all external calls.


Document integration endpoints and usage patterns in docs/thirdParty.md.
