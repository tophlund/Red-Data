Integrate analytics service (e.g., Segment) in client; track key events: model creation, metric addition, AI suggestion seen.

Anonymize user identifiers in telemetry; use hashed IDs.

Send batch event uploads every 30 seconds; avoid excessive network usage.

Capture frontend performance metrics (FID, LCP) and send to monitoring service.

Monitor API performance: record response times and error rates; trigger alerts on 5xx spike.

Implement health check endpoint (GET /api/v1/health) returning service status.

Use uptime monitoring (e.g., Pingdom) to ping health endpoint every minute.

Log custom metrics (e.g., model save frequency) to InfluxDB or similar.

Visualize dashboards in Grafana; update panels monthly to reflect new metrics.


Retain analytics data for 12 months; purge older data automatically.
