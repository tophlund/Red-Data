Enforce TypeScript strict mode; disallow any except in explicit exceptions with justification comments.

Use ESLint with a defined config extending eslint:recommended and plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended; fail builds on lint errors.

Name files to match default exports; use .ts or .tsx extensions based on content.

Organize imports: external packages first, internal aliases second, relative imports last; sort alphabetically within groups.

Apply Prettier formatting: 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas in multiline, max line length 80.

Disallow console statements; use a centralized logger utility.

Use explicit return types on all functions and React components.

Avoid inline anonymous functions in JSX; extract event handlers to named functions.

Document complex logic with inline comments; avoid commented-out code blocks.


Require commit messages to follow Conventional Commits format.
