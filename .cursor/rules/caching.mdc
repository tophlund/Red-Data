Cache metric lists and lookup tables with 5-minute TTL in Redis; update on data changes.

Use HTTP Cache-Control headers for static assets: public, max-age=86400.

Implement server-side response caching for GET /api/v1/metrics with ETag support.

Invalidate cache on model update or metric modification events.

Cache AI suggestion responses for identical metric combinations for 10 minutes.

Use in-memory LRU cache for client-side computations; limit to 100 entries.

Leverage Remix loader caching: set cache-control headers in loader responses.

Monitor cache hit/miss ratios; adjust TTLs based on usage patterns.

Do not cache personalized or sensitive data; restrict to publicly sharable data.

Document caching layers and invalidation logic in docs/caching.md.
