Design all screens to follow a 12-column responsive grid; breakpoint definitions: sm=640px, md=768px, lg=1024px, xl=1280px.

Use Tailwind CSS utility classes consistently; avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.

All interactive elements must use accessible ARIA roles and labels.

Drag-and-drop interactions: use HTML5 drag events with clear visual drop targets and fallback for touch devices.

Builder canvas: render metric cards with clear icons, tooltips on hover displaying metric descriptions.

Sidebar panels: should collapse and expand; use concise headings and consistent typography.

Modal components: trap focus, allow ESC to close, include descriptive titles and close buttons.

Button styles: primary actions use solid background, secondary actions use outlined style; disable on invalid states.

Forms: label each field explicitly, display inline validation errors, prevent form submission until valid.


Provide visual feedback for asynchronous operations: spinner or skeleton loader for data fetches.
