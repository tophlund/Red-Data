Define seed scripts in prisma/seed.ts; use Prisma Client to insert static data (metrics, positions, teams).

Version migrations: run prisma migrate dev for local development; commit generated SQL files.

Maintain separate seed datasets per environment: seed.dev.ts, seed.prod.ts.

Rollback procedure: use prisma migrate resolve to mark migrations applied/unapplied.

Automate seed execution in CI after migrations; ensure idempotent seeds.

Validate seed data uniqueness: enforce constraints in code and schema.

Document migration steps in docs/migrations.md; include rollback commands.

Archive historical migrations; never modify applied migration files.

Test migrations in a clean database in CI; fail build on migration errors.


Use migration naming convention with timestamp and description: 20250606_init_metrics.
